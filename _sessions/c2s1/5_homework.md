### Work on your group cheatsheet

{% exercise %}
Continue to add information to your group cheatsheet. At the very least you should
1. Have a section for the basic command line commands.
2. Have a section for the basic git commands.
3. Have each pushed to the shared repository at least twice by next week.

### Learn to hate your track pad

From now on, try to touch your mouse/trackpad as little as often - it will make you quicker and more effective.

{% exercise %}
1. Practise using `Cmd-tab` (Mac) or `Ctrl-tab` (Windows) to move between programs.
2. Practise using `Cmd-space` (Mac) or ?? (Windows) to open programs by typing their names.
3. Practise using short cut keys:
    - `Cmd-s` (Mac) or `Ctrl-s` (Windows) for saving
    - `Cmd-r` (Mac) or `Ctrl-r` (Windows) to refresh the browser
