### Add a contact form to your personal site

{% exercise %}
Add a form to collect the email address of people who visit your personal site. It should submit to a google form, which should then send you an email to let you know someone sent you their email address.

### Start on the landing page project

For the final few weeks of the course you will be working on teams to design a landing page.

{% exercise %}
1. Form teams of 2-3 to work together.
2. Read [The Brief](/ocl_project), which directs you to build a landing page for the coding course. If you have a different idea that you'd rather work on, that's fine - it just needs to be a landing page for something integrated with a form to collect people's details.
3. Make a start on your HTML, CSS and site copy. You'll have the next two homeworks to work on this, but the more you get done now the better!
