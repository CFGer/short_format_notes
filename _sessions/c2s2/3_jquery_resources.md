title: jQuery resources
---

Obviously, we've only just scratched the surface of what's possible with javascript/jQuery. Things get a lot more interesting when you can create bits of javascript to be run in response to a user action. This allows you to build up interactions like "when the user clicks the submit button, check that their email is a valid email, if it isn't make the field go red and add the words 'email is invalid' at the bottom of the form". 

### Learning more jQuery

We won't be spending any more time on jQuery this course, and will be moving onto backend stuff next term. If you want to learn more about jQuery you might want to try some of the following resources:

* The [Codecademy jQuery course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery)
* The [jQuery learning center](http://learn.jquery.com/)
* The [Codeschool jQuery course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery)

### jsFiddle

jsFiddle is a site which allows you to try out small bits of HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's a really useful tool for getting good help with javascript (and HTML/CSS) online: If you're having a problem:

1. Create a jsFiddle showing what you've tried.
2. Post on StackOverflow describing the problem, with a link to the jsFiddle.

People will be able to help you better if they can see the code themselves. Often they will respond with a working jsFiddle (as in [this example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11489037/add-and-remove-attribute-with-jquery))
